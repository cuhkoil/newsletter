There are many open-tech interest groups in Hong Kong and they have
regular events like meetups, workshops and hackathons. Those are

Club 18, 18-20 Lyndhurst Terrace, Central, Hong Kong
  
 Calling all entr-app-reneurs! As a continuation of our popular "Battle
of the Apps" series, we are once again inviting app creators, developers
and publishers to compete in a live contest in the heart of Hong Kong's
entertainment area. Networking will start at 6:30pm, with the battle
from 7:15pm on 23rd July 2014 at Club 18, 18-20 Lyndhurst Terrace,
Central, Hong Kong. All apps welcome, be it on iOS, Android, Blackberry,
Windows, Chrome or Symbian (TV, tablet or smartphone). Submit your App
via: http://bit.ly/boasignup Each contestant will have 5 minutes to
present their creation, followed by questions from the floor. Due to
time limitations, there will be a maximum of 10 contestants. At the end
of the evening, the audience will vote with their fingers (old
fashioned, analogue stickers!). The most popular app will win great
prizes and a full interview slot at a future Web Wednesday Social Mixer
with all the associated promotional benefits. Do help spread the word so
that we can attract a wide range of contestants. Use hashtag
"#battleofapps". #bringyourgame (to borrow from the HK Rugby 7s)
